# Tutor Plus

## Description

Tutor Plus is an application built with simplicity in mind. It provides tutors a way to assign homework to their students and for students to be able to view the homework, download it, complete it and upload it back for the tutor to check. This simple organizational tool takes all the stress out of remembering who had what assignment and who completed them.

[Video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/syS3NQz1lzk): demonstration of the application on the front end.
[Associated blog post](https://medium.com/@mykovasyl/tutor-plus-ruby-on-rails-4960a37c3ae2): here I talk about the backend associations between the Tutor and Student models which includes STI, User 'type', and subclass associations.

**Note on routing**: react-router-dom v6 was used. When changing front-end Routes, please double check your syntax. For more information, [check out this blog](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-router/)

## Current and future versions

In the current version, the student model is not built out fully and only allows a student to sign up, view and change their profile, and delete the account. The tutor model is fully built to find students, assign homework, delete the homework, as well as view and change the profile, and delete the account.

In future versions, I will implement ActiveStorage so tutors can upload files for the assignments for the students to download and complete. The homepage will be made into a dashboard for the tutor to see statistics on the assignments completed, updates on outstanding assignments, and other relevant information.

## Cloning To Run Locally

The application is currently deployed with render. If you would like to run the application in localhost, do the following:

Start by **cloning** the application repository and removing the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:mykovasyl/phase-4-project-concert-goer.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc. â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those
files on GitHub will cause issues.

[create repo]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line#adding-a-project-to-github-without-github-cli

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

# Frontend set up: npm and local server

## NPM install

Run 'npm install --prefix client' to install the package for the front end.

## Localhost Set-up

The current version of this application is set up to be deployed.

If you would like to run a localhost server, include the following changes to your cloned repo:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

Make sure to commit these changes to your cloned repo and run `bundle install` before launching the servers.

# Backend set up: migrations and seeding

## Migrations

To set up the database using migrations, run 'rails db:migrate'.

If changes need to be made to a migration, first run 'rails db:rollback' until you've rolled back the migration you're looking to change. After making the necessary changes, run 'rails db:migrate' once again.

New migrations can be created using the rails generator 'rails g migration NAME_OF_MIGRATION'. Remember to use '--no-test-framework' at the end of a generator if you're not building out your own test code.

If you make a mistake when creating the generator in CLI, run 'rails d migration NAME_OF_MIGRATION'

## Seeding

The seed file includes a template for seeding data. To make seeding easier, the faker gem was included in the Gemfile. Get more info on [faker gem here](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)

Run 'rails db:seed' to seed data.

If there are issues with the seed data and new data needs to be used, comment out the seed file and run 'rails db:reset' to drop and re-setup the DB.

# Starting the servers

You can use the following commands to run the application servers:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Shut down servers with control+C.
